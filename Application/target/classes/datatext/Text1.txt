The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Life is like a box of chocolates.
The early bird catches the worm.
Actions speak louder than words.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
A penny saved is a penny earned.
All's well that ends well.
Practice makes perfect.
Time waits for no man.
Better late than never.
Two heads are better than one.
Out of sight, out of mind.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
Honesty is the best policy.
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
The grass is always greener on the other side.
The squeaky wheel gets the grease.
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
When the going gets tough, the tough get going.
